Year 3217
---------
Earth had become over-populated, forcing us to expand into the solar system. We were able to find a few habitable planets and began terraforming them to support mass populations.
During this process, we began getting strange transmissions from outside the galaxy. The transmissions are unlike anything we have heard, and we are unable to decode their meaning.
Shortly after we began receieving these transmissions we started to notice anomolies on our long range scanners. At first they were a few blips at random intervals. We deployed a 
team to investigate and what we found was an alien force massing at the edge of the solar system. Our team was destroyed and the alien force began moving towards us. Within a few 
months they were upon us. They began their seige on Earth, wiping out nearly the entire population. 

Year 3417 - Present Day
-----------------------
For 200 years we have been in a constant state of war. The aliens, who we have named The Scourge, have all but wiped out hummanity. We only exist in small pockets scattered across the solar system.
Mars is the remaining bastion of hope for the human race, and you are our only hope at survival...
